# Individual Project 1 - Front-end Web Development 

## Overview and Requirements 

I started with a basic HTML file that displayed my photo, name, and other information. Later, I reused the work I had completed as part of Lab2, such as showing functionality for email, displaying an analogue and digital clock, and using JS code to view Gifs. Later, I used my index.html file with the api's like JOkeAPI and Weatherbit api. Furthermore, I enabled cookies in my index.html using Javascript. This project has covered topics ranging from HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ajax, and jQuery, and has used APIs to retrieve the data..

I have uploaded the code in my private repository [https://github.com/sohanchidvilasbodapati.github.io] (https://github.com/sohanchidvilasbodapati.github.io)


### Task 1: github.io

As part of this work, I built a repository on github called github.io, using the naming  that the lecturer specified. I then made the repository public. I then cloned my repository onto my local workspace and generated waph.html in accordance with video lecture 6. After that, I made an index.html file with a headshot of my image and a few basic HTML headings. My lab 2's code has been copied into the index.html file. 

#### a.Creation and cloning:
As per your professor's advice, I started by creating a repository on GitHub using the  naming convention. It's essential to follow this naming pattern for GitHub Pages to identify your website as a personal one. 
You lay the groundwork for hosting your website on GitHub by following this protocol.
You then made the public access to your GitHub repository. Enabling public access to your website requires completing this crucial step. Repositories can be viewed by everyone by setting their visibility to the public, which is in line with GitHub Pages' goal of serving as a platform for project sharing and exhibition.

By adding a new HTML file called "waph.html" to your website, you increased its content as per the instructions from a video class (class 6). More  features could be implemented in this file, potentially incorporating the lecture's teachings.  dynamic website created by having distinct HTML files.


####  b. Bootstrap files

Professor has suggested to use Bootstrap as part of this assignment and in order to do that I have searched for free bootstrap themes online and selected one of the theme and modified it according to my requirement. In addition to that, I have downloaded bootstrap from the official website and included it in my html file. I have used my resume in pdf format and created multiple divs and subpages to align my resume within the website. In addition to that, I have used the css to add forms with div,images in a frames.

#### c. Javascript files

I have utilized various features, such as the digital clock, analog clock, and show email capabilities as a continuation of lab 2. Furthermore I have incorporated JokesAPI and Weatherbit API into the index.html file by using the API concept. Every minute, a joke is randomly displayed by the JokesAPI, while the Weatherbit api shows the local weather.
The Weatherbit API is available to the public, but in order to utilise it, each user must create a unique API key, which they must then integrate into their code. For example, the JokesAPI presents a random joke instead of requiring an API key.
The free flag counter website is embedded into index.html and adds a new country flag

The primary goal of the website's cookie management is to notify users that they have already visited this page at a specific time. The website shows a welcome message the first time a user sees it, and it shows a "welcome back" message every time a user returns, followed by the previous timestamp. To improve usability, cookies have a 30-day lifespan.

In addition to that, I have intergrated a random luck genratore with a java script that that just genrates a random lucky number accordingly. From lab2 we have a major code for the clock and the analog.
