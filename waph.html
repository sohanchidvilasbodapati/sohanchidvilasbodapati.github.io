        Course Description <br>
        In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end
        (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will 
        be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and
        practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.<br>
        <h2> Topics (Tentative):</h2>
        ❖ The Web and Web Application <br>
        ❖ Client-side Web Development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript <br>
        ❖ Server-side Web Application Development with PHP and Database (MySQL) <br>
        ❖ Version control (git) and DevOps <br>
        ❖ Web Application Security: Vulnerabilities and Attacks with Hands-on Exercises <br>
        ❖ Secure Web Programming Principles and Practices <br>
        <h2>Course Goals and Objectives: </h2>
        <h3>Students will have the ability to:</h3>
        ❖ obtain the ability and skills to effectively use state-of-the-art techniques in web application 
        development and security tools for the analysis, design, and implementation of secure web 
        systems <br>
        ❖ enhance students programming skills to develop secure, robust, sustainable software products <br>  
        ❖ establish security analysis skills to identify and avoid potential web vulnerabilities <br>
        ❖ identify the types of security threats and perform attacks in web applications and adopt 
        corresponding countermeasures to prevent such attacks <br>
        ❖ obtain the ability and skills to apply practical knowledge of security in designing and 
        implementing web applications with contemporary programming technologies.<br>
        <h2>Course Outcomes: </h2>
        <h3> Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to </h3>:
        ❖ design, implement, and evaluate a web-based solution to meet a given set of computing 
        requirements in the context of the programs discipline <br>
        ❖ understand the principle aspects of concepts of web application security <br>
        ❖ identify and discuss the types of security threats and attacks in web applications and practical 
        experience with hands-on exercises <br>
        ❖ adopt corresponding countermeasures to identified threats in web applications and argue their 
        effectiveness <br>
        ❖ apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing web applications with 
        contemporary technologie <br>
